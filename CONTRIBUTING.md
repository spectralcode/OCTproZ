There are four main ways to contribute: issue reports, feature requests, code contributions and plug-in development.  


Issue Reports
----------
- Check if the issue you want to report or a similar one was already reported on the [OCTproZ issue page](https://github.com/spectralcode/OCTproZ/issues). Feel free to comment on already existing issue reports to provide additional information. 
- Report new issues by using the "Bug report"-template if applicable.


Feature Requests
----------
- Check if the feature you want to request or a similar one was already requested on the [OCTproZ issue page](https://github.com/spectralcode/OCTproZ/issues). Feel free to comment on already existing feature requests to provide additional information. 
- Request new features by using the "Feature request"-template if applicable.


Code Contributions
----------
- Before creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), please announce your plans in the [OCTproZ issue page](https://github.com/spectralcode/OCTproZ/issues). This enables an open discussion which will get the best out of your efforts. 
- Currently there is no style guide. New code should be more or less consistent with the style of already existing code.


Plug-ins
----------
- If you have developed a plug-in for OCTproZ and want it to be mentioned in the [OCTproZ README.md](https://github.com/spectralcode/OCTproZ/blob/master/README.md), please contact us.
- Contact information can be found at the bottom of the [user manual](https://spectralcode.github.io/OCTproZ/index.html)
