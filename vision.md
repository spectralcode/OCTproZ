General vision
----------
OCTproZ should:
- be an easy to use OCT signal processing and visualization software for researchers that utilize OCT.
- enable everyone to use custom build OCT systems without the hassle of having to write the processing software
- __provide open OCT processing algorithms to make scientific research more reproducible__



Long-term goals
----------
- Implement OCT processing pipeline in other frameworks besides CUDA (e.g. OpenCL, OpenMP, C ++ AMP) to support various computer hardware for processing
- Plugin database for most common OCT system hardware configurations
- Advanced visualization for live view of acquired OCT data (e.g. speckle variance, spectroscopic)
- Python or scripting interface either as plugin or integrated within OCTproZ
